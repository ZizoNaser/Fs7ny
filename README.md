FCI Graduation Project 2018 Implemented by Zizo Naser, Mohamed Fawzy and Israa Abdelnaby
## Project Idea:
	Nowadays the youth especially in our great country Egypt faces a problem when they decide to take a vacation. The problem of preparing for such trips is managed by many companies that offers trips and voyages but they donâ€™t have a platform to advertise their offers. So a system is required to be the platform where the customer can view and surf offers made by deferent companies and select an offer that suits him and be able to book tickets and pay for them on the platform.
